Hello,

This is a fully completed task.

I totally enjoyed creating this small project. First I designed the UI and then eventually i moved ahead with the functionality.

The functionality which i have managed in this is whenever a user clicks on the add button, a new set of question and answer is added and it is displayed at the bottom.

The list is having a delete button too via which a particular question can be deleted and the list is re-ordered.

Full app is TYPESCRIPTED and the Entire state is stored in redux. And the end the JSON data is printed on the console.
Complete project is typescripted

Just to show the functionality of react-router I have added a route to Login page also by clicking on the Login button.

I havent used any pre-defined library for the UI elements. Complete design is done in Pure CSS using style.module.css files.

What I really found interesting about this project was adding and the deleting the data on the same page itself. It was fun to do that.

Scope of Improvement : We can add debouncing using useEffect to cut down the number of rendering of the components. Although its a small project so it goes well. But if we really have a very big one we can go for debouncing.

run-
npm install
npm run start
